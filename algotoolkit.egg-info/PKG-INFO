```

## 🚀 Usage
```python
from alokpykit.algo_utils import bubble_sort, binary_search

# Sorting Example
arr = [5, 2, 9, 1]
sorted_arr = bubble_sort(arr)
print("Sorted Array:", sorted_arr)

# Searching Example
target = 2
index = binary_search(sorted_arr, target)
print(f"Element found at index {index}")
```
